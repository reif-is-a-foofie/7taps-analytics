# Assignments and Heartbeats

Purpose: Enable parallel work across agents with clear ownership, dependencies, deliverables, and mandatory heartbeats in line with `agents/orchestrator_agent.mdc`.

## Heartbeat Requirements
- Cadence: Every 15 minutes while working on a contract.
- Where: Update the assigned contract JSON at `project_management/contracts/<contract_id>.json`.
- Format: Append a JSON object to `heartbeats` with the following fields and update `last_heartbeat` and `current_agent`.

Heartbeat JSON template:
```json
{
  "agent": "<agent_name>",
  "contract_id": "<contract_id>",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-14T12:00:00Z",
  "files_modified": ["<file1>", "<file2>"],
  "code_metrics": {
    "lines_of_code": 0,
    "functions_implemented": 0,
    "endpoints_created": 0,
    "test_coverage": 0,
    "files_completed": 0
  },
  "progress_percentage": 0,
  "next_milestone": "<short description>",
  "current_status": "in_progress",
  "blocking_issues": [],
  "completion_estimate": "<ETA>",
  "last_activity": "<what you did since last heartbeat>"
}
```

Additionally (recommended): POST a test/validation report to `/api/debug/test-report` if the app is running.

  - Deliverables:
    - Identify sensitive envs (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, webhook secret)
    - Use `--set-secrets` to source from Secret Manager
    - Document creation/rotation of secrets
  - Validation:
    - No secrets present in repo/build files; runtime env populated from secrets

- Contract: `gc17_monitoring_alerts_setup`

    - Document thresholds and notification channels
  - Validation:
    - `gcloud monitoring policies list` shows policies targeting service

- Contract: `gc18_contracts_cleanup`

  - Deliverables:
    - Update service name to `taps-analytics-ui`; standardize port 8080
    - Document AR usage and service account requirements
  - Validation:
    - Docs reflect deployed state and steps are runnable

## General Rules
- Follow `.cursorrules` and file boundaries defined in each contractâ€™s `allowed_files`.
- Produce a short progress report JSON under `project_management/progress_reports/` named after the contract when meaningful milestones are hit.
- Do not mark a contract completed until validation conditions are met and tests (where applicable) pass.
