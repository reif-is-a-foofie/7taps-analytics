Meeting Title: Data analytics and user journey setup for course launch
Date: Sep 18

Transcript:
 
Them: Recording in progress. That means once they click that seven taps email, they're kind of like. It's all sort of embedded, where it's like, okay, here's your email. Just follow this email all the way to the end sort of thing, because it's, you know, click that big bottom button that says, you know, start your lesson. And then they're just going. And then they're able to get to the end of the lesson. Oh, part two. Click that. And then it's like, just keep going. Yeah. And I think, like, in the welcome message, it can be just like, you know, we can literally say, like, there's a couple short, super short modules that are going to take you ready for next week. So this message needs to change. So welcome. By signing up your time, I'm just going to read this quickly. By signing up, you're telling us that you're ready to take control, blah, blah, blah, not build a life and career. Build a life. Full of progress, opportunities of people that make you come alive. And then we can say when it's going to start here. We can say this. This is. These are. We are getting you up to speed. So you have all you need. When I'm just quickly, of course, starts. October 6th. Now's the time. Take a few minutes now. Get up to speed. I'll reveal that, and then we don't need to say.  
Me: I'll review this. And then we don't need to say this.  
Them: I mean. Maybe. But this goes away. And I'll review this a little bit more. And then basically, then there's link to lessons zero. Sequence. Hi, reif.  
Me: Holy hello.  
Them: So we are not going to have the welcome email go from mailchimp. It's going to come from seven taps, which is makes a lot more sense. So once they put in their information and they select their avatar, they then get redirected. To. Well, should the hype video. Is that weird gauge? For them to go. They put in their stuff. Like, shouldn't they just immediately get this? And should the hype video be at the very beginning? No, because it takes a minute for you to onboard them because there's no automated way to add to the system. Okay. Can you. That's not opposed to being, like, you know, just instead of redirecting to the hype video, It's not posted. Just redirecting and then being like, hey, you'll receive an email soon. If we did want to include just the hype video. Oh, no, it should be both. Can you show me? I'm going to stop share. Can you share screen and show me the hype video? Because we need to make sure that there's a message put there that says, after they watch it, just look for an email. Or were we going to put that in the call to action at the end of the hyp video? I really don't want to do any more video editing. It's very expensive. Although, you know. Sign up have option add phone number as well. Unless we want to make it required, but. I think that's fine to be optional. And should. That's a broke. Okay. This worked yesterday. I don't know what happened. Gotta love that demos don't work. Reif knows.  
Me: Yeah. But it's better today. Hey.  
Them: But then I just have this. I actually took this directly from. Whatever it's called, the welcome originally. So does this play automatically? It should. We can't have it play automatically. But because we can only we can have it play automatically, but it'd be at zero volume. So okay. Either way, just addicts of Apple's restrictions on stuff like that. In a perfect world, should it be a gift? That makes them want to click on it with, like, a click button. Can we do a click button over it that. That moves? Yeah, we should be able to. Okay. I want to do something that just encourages them to click on it. Yeah. Also, this was the layout. I don't know if it's better to have it be side by side. Layout. Yes, definitely. I'll get that all fixed up. But okay. And Laura can take a, you know, crack at it, too, once you get it all set. So that's great. And. Yeah. Anything we can do to make it. Make them click on it would be great. So let's go back to the sequence. So going back to the sequence, I'm gonna put this on your list. To do gauge is to put that those messages in the right order. Sure and know that. Language may change, and if you could flag it and highlight it, it meaning, like, certain lessons were going into the weekend or coming after the weekend, and we had to, like, rearrange all the language based on how we had reorganized the lesson sequence. Yeah, I think most of that's all set, but I'll do another pass through. Okay, that sounds great. So that's on your list. And then I'm just gonna go back to. The list we were on. Hold on a second. Okay, so. That was review. So I'm gonna change this and just say age to update lesson sequence. In. That I wouldn't have called it evm daily emails, but. Okay? Review leader, Kate. And jo. Can you link this here? And I'll tag joe. When once you link it, will you tag the two of us in a comment? Yep. Okay. And then course, Hub. Is that? Where is that with. Resources. And citations. I'll have to go through and check to see if any additional ones. Were changed or anything, but all the ones that were in the document. Lila put a while back. Those are in. Right now. Okay, so I'm gonna make a note so you know it Kate is adding for there were no social media was a new lesson. So I'm adding for social media and added one for sleep. And then just if you can, again, make sure they're in the right order. And then. The course of video edit to. There's. What is this edit to motivationally? Oh, that's gone. Did. Has all this been done, do you know? I'm not sure about the edits part, but. Can you go? I'm gonna stop share. Can you go to Course Hub right now and we can. What is that? Remove. Oh, it's right. All towards the video. Those remove things. Oh. You're right. Okay, that was the old video. You're right. Gone. Review text by users okay. Now I'm gonna go to user, back to user journey. And I'll get out of share screen in one second. But do we have SOPs? This is for both you guys. Both you and Reif. Do we have SOPs for user journey? Yes, we do. Do we have one for Data? Data management Reif.  
Me: I think. We can do better.  
Them: Cool.  
Me: I do have a ton. Of how the system works, blah, blah, blah. So if it's done, you delete it.  
Them: Yeah, I can leave it there. Do you need it there?  
Me: It's like finding nemo. My bubbles.  
Them: So.  
Me: Yeah. Let me add SOP data. So the SOPs for somebody who's driving the system, right?  
Them: I just think, like, we have to capture. Yeah, I mean, I think we just have to capture, like, what's in your mind and what's been decided on so that we know what we did and how we're doing it and how we're managing it and what the whole world of, like, of data. Management is. I don't want you to spend a ton of time, but I feel like we do have to have some. Record of that.  
Me: Yep. Just click on this really quickly so you can see.  
Them: Wait. Click on what?  
Me: Give me a second.  
Them: Don't take me anyplace yet. Hang on a second. Let me just take this in.  
Me: Understood?  
Them: Gage. You're gonna do this at the end. Yeah. As I've been going through, been updating it, but I'll do a full pass when it's like everything's finalized. Okay. And the learning path setup is you. And then at end, of course, consider. Choose your own adventure. We'll move that for now because it's not happening right now. Fillable tracker notifications for trigger words. That's a question mark. Clear disclaimer. We got that done. Citations. We'll worry about that later. And then this is us. Okay, now I'm gonna get out of share screen. All right. Hello. You have a meeting at 10. Is that right, Reif?  
Me: Yeah. That's correct. I've got a meeting at 10.  
Them: Okay, so if you could update us now on your world, that would be amazing.  
Me: Excellent. Yeah. Let me go to share screen. Okay? Cool. Hello, everyone. You can see my screen. Yes.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Confirmed. So any of these that look highlighted, it's because I made sure to assign them to myself so I can track them, right? So these are all my things. Quickly on the data management. Here is the. It's pretty technical. That's why it took me a long time to answer the question, because I have this whole SOP here.  
Them: Got it.  
Me: That shows how it works. But it's a little technical, right?  
Them: Okay? Okay. No, that's fine. As long as. As long as you have that. And I think, like, we also need a simple, super simple, like Kate proof. This is the order in which things are being done. Like this happens. This happens before the course starts. This happens as the course is going. This happens. This is the time frame. These are the outcomes. You know what I mean? Like, this is why, like, just simple explanation would be really helpful.  
Me: Yeah, absolutely. And so I will just capture that here, where it's basically like any. Okay. Explain. Also review. And process of datablo.  
Them: Thank you. And then, how are things going? Did you have more to say in here?  
Me: Yeah, I'll just touch on. I think we want to go here, right? With data analytics.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Okay, cool. So it's way cleaned up from last time. This is live. Notice it doesn't say localhost here. So anybody can actually jump in. Clean up the Data Explorer. Finally, September actually works. Problematic users. And the big thing is that the endpoint is ready. What does that mean? It means that I had to let all this was running, but I didn't let seven taps know that. Hey, there's a new endpoint.  
Them: Oh.  
Me: Yeah. Where the frick is all the data?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So this is data that I brought in myself.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: But the new data is not streaming. I finished that. We tested it. Just waiting.  
Them: So I saw him say that he had put in a request. Is that. Does that take a while or that's done?  
Me: I finished my side and then I pinged them yesterday. You saw? And so I'm waiting for the confirmation.  
Them: Yeah. So when you've asked them in the past for things, is it or is it long?  
Me: That got you. Last time it was 24 hours.  
Them: Okay, great. Awesome.  
Me: And then we should be at, like, hour 20 already, right?  
Them: Okay? Cool. Cool, cool.  
Me: Yeah. Game on. And also I realized that you need to filter by group, by cohort.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So that's really important because all the data doesn't necessarily matter to me as much as which group.  
Them: For sure.  
Me: So we fix that.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: We? Me and my alter ego. Because it's just me, actually.  
Them: Royally. Like what?  
Me: Yeah, that's totally Royal Wii status. Because I'm all alone there's no one here beside me.  
Them: I feel you receive.  
Me: So, yeah, feeling actually really good.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And then, thanks to Gage, who sent me all this, Because then.  
Them: That. Wait, stop, stop. Stop. By the way, own your mindset is not own your mindset anymore, so just. Okay, I didn't update any of the details, all right? I just want to make sure we don't build anything on the wrong sequence.  
Me: Okay? Understood. Yeah, this is just for testing, so I can make sure I'm pulling in all X API. And then one other thing to note, that was kind of a headache, but like a fun headache.  
Them: Okay? Okay?  
Me: X API doesn't send all the data. So, for instance, voice. Yeah. Photo's voice, et cetera. There's holes in there. So I had to make it such that we could update our own data and it doesn't overlap and blah, blah, blah. So we have to get it from two sources to make one full picture.  
Them: You said, not photos and stuff like that. Okay?  
Me: It's done. Yeah, it's done.  
Them: Amazing. Oh, my gosh. This has been so much work. I'm really excited.  
Me: Yeah. This is pretty dang.  
Them: Pretty slick. Okay, can we get out of here for a second? Because it's not showing me anything that I need to know.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: Even though it's showing you a lot of things you need to know. I'm just seeing a bunch of, like, numbers in Bach, and I don't know what they mean. So tell me, Tell me what's left on your list in order to be running.  
Me: Yeah. So the big thing is, I want confirmation from 7taps that it's running, and then I want to jump into lessons.  
Them: Right.  
Me: And make sure that all that data is hitting the database. Once that happens, man,  
Them: Okay? We're good to go. Okay?  
Me: Yeah, exactly.  
Them: And then I would love to see an example of We've got the progress emails. Which I'm gonna look at the copy again, but I think you did a great job. Does that copy change? Or you're gonna. The data points that you pull in are gonna change, right? And then.  
Me: And the recipient.  
Them: Right. And so how do you and I or the team, how do we in the moment? Know what data points you're choosing. We need to come up with a practical plan for when it's running. Because I realize that's a daily thing that actually has to be a decision. On the fly in order to then implement or input that into the message to send.  
Me: That. Yeah. And so the base is okay. What? All is the data that was collected today? Right. And then once, and we already have that, that's what the whole thing is for, then we can effectively create insights from those things, and then the team can.  
Them: Right. So how much time does that take and when does it happen? Daily. Like, we need to come up with an exact plan because you're gonna do your life. I'm gonna be doing my life. We're gonna need to, like, say okay every day at this time. Yeah.  
Me: Run this? Yes.  
Them: So can you think about that? And to, like, what do you think? What is the right time? What's the right process? Is it in slack? You jump into slack and you go. These are three points.  
Me: Nice.  
Them: Choose one. Or, like, what do you. What's the best way to do that?  
Me: Gotcha. Yeah. The. The big thing I want to note here. Is we did all this work royally. But all of it, all of us together, such that running the analytics should take seven minutes.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: It shouldn't take four hours a day, right? Because then.  
Them: Got it. That's amazing. So then that is run. But then we still need to.  
Me: Yeah, we need to actually do it. Is that a 7pM thing? Is it a 5pm you know.  
Them: Well, we should tie it with gauge because gauge is now. We just made a decision that we think and I'm curious what you think. We were saying that we think that the progress daily progress. Email or text. Should go get to them at 7pm because it gives a lot of space for them to actually do the lesson or not do it. And because kids are up later, they're probably like going to the library doing their study stuff at night. And they've probably got hopefully gotten through dinner by then. So that's 5pm his time. To be because he has to do a little tiny thing.  
Me: Right.  
Them: On his end to send it every time. Because he. Because we have to say who's done it and who hasn't done it.  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: So if it's 5pm his time, that's. 6pm Your time.  
Me: That's right. Y.  
Them: That's not a good time because that's family time for you.  
Me: Eah. But I. I should be able to, like, do it.  
Them: But we can do it before then. Yeah, like, we could do it like, an hour or so before. It should be fine.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay, so should we say that by so what time is so by? 4pm My time. 4:00pm Eastern time every day.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Like, what works for you, Reif, because you have your own flow with your family and work. Like, could I want it to be completely set so that then I am not like, oh, my God, I'm out, you know, hiking, and I can't decide.  
Me: Yeah. I would. The In a perfect world. The. The analytics should be able to be done by someone else. Because it's effectively automatic.  
Them: Like gauge.  
Me: Yeah. Exactly. Or whoever's sending the email. It's like, hey, give me the. I'm running this group on this day. Give me the data, please.  
Them: But how much data we get, like, how many? Just, like, remember when we were trying to find quotes for to share with leadership and we were like, oh, like, going through all this data. So, like, if it's a lesson's worth of data, Another thing.  
Me: Go in a bit.  
Them: How how delayed is like text API and gathering that data is pretty instant as far as like, we'll get those. Or is it like, oh, it takes two hours for this data to show on our end.  
Me: Yeah, that's a good question. Gage. It's instant.  
Them: Okay, thanks.  
Me: It's near instant, yeah.  
Them: Just cuz. Yeah, the earlier we go, I mean, that is always the risk because that's a chance we might get less actual user data if someone's doing it, you know, right at the last minute before we send our progress.  
Me: Right. So. That's what the sop needs to be about. Right.  
Them: Yeah. And I think this is a beautiful. It's a beautiful thing, but if it's like, I mean, we're going to do it for you no matter what, right? So. But I think it's like we have to really understand and we won't know, and part of it is experimenting with it. But if you could, for example, Reif go through a trial and take a lesson and all the data. From it.  
Me: Yeah, exactly.  
Them: And generate a report and then send that over to us for me to look at and forget. All three of us to look at and go. Or even Laura, too, and be. No, don't involve Laura, the three of us and say, like, okay, what would we pull from this? Because we will get better at it and we will get fast at it, where we're like, oh, that's the kind of data point that we want.  
Me: 100%. And I'll just say, like, I think the. The big thing to take away from this is that if it's not clean, I'm also afraid. Not just you.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You know what I mean? It's like, I want this stuff to be clean and nice and not create headaches.  
Them: Yeah. Right? And then.  
Me: So right now, I'm not. I'm not in a place where I feel confident that we can get clean data. But I'm gonna get to that point right now.  
Them: Okay. And does your. Your. You have to go. It's 958.  
Me: Oh, yeah. Okay?  
Them: Okay? So I would like to continue this conversation because we're not finished, and we're gonna get on with Patrick this afternoon. So let's, I guess, pick it up, then.  
Me: Yeah. I got quite a bit of context, though, from you, which is very helpful. And so I know at least the two thirds of what needs done.  
Them: Okay? Okay? I have complete confidence in you guys because I know we're all wanting the same thing, but I'm also like, oh, my gosh, we have a week to go.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Like we have a week.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It scares me a little bit. But it's giving me, like, the reality of. Okay, you built the thing. Now. Just make the thing do this. At least the thing's built right.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: So appreciate.  
Them: But could you. Could your thing select? Could your thing recommend data points?  
Me: Yeah, we could make it recommended points.  
Them: Anyhow about that. Go by.  
Me: I appreciate you.  
Them: Gage. Thank you. We'll talk this afternoon. Yep, sounds good. Bye, guys.
