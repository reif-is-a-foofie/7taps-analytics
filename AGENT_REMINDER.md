# 🤖 AGENT REMINDER: Commit Frequently!

## 🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR ALL AGENTS

**Before you start any development work, read this:**

### 📋 Commit Checklist (Do This Every Time):
- [ ] Make logical change to file(s)
- [ ] **IMMEDIATELY** run `./quick-commit.sh` or `git qc`
- [ ] Continue with next logical change
- [ ] **IMMEDIATELY** commit again
- [ ] Repeat until task complete

### ⚡ Quick Commands:
```bash
./quick-commit.sh    # Full-featured commit & push
git qc               # Super-fast commit & push
./dev-reminder.sh    # Check status
```

### 🎯 Why This Matters:
1. **Never lose work** - commits save progress
2. **Real-time collaboration** - others see changes immediately
3. **Easy debugging** - find when issues were introduced
4. **Simple rollbacks** - revert specific changes
5. **Clear history** - timeline of development decisions

### ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Waiting until "everything is perfect"
- Making huge commits with multiple changes
- Forgetting to push changes
- Waiting until end of large tasks

### ✅ Best Practice Examples:

#### Good Workflow:
```
1. Create file → Commit
2. Add function → Commit  
3. Fix bug → Commit
4. Add tests → Commit
```

#### Bad Workflow:
```
1. Create file
2. Add function
3. Fix bug
4. Add tests
5. Commit everything at once ❌
```
