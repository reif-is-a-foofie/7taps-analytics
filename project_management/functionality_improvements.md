# Functionality Improvements Backlog

## gc.14 Trigger Word Alerts - 2025-09-29T16:34:23Z
- Implemented `app/api/trigger_word_alerts.py` to manage configurable trigger words, 30-day alert retention, retroactive BigQuery scans, and SMTP-based notifications.
- Integrated alert evaluation into both API and Cloud Function ingestion paths so detection runs before Pub/Sub publishes.
- Added `/api/xapi/alerts/trigger-words` endpoint and enriched `/api/xapi/recent` with alert summaries for UI consumption.
- Tests: `pytest tests/test_xapi_ingestion_pipeline.py tests/test_seventaps_webhook.py` *(fails: ModuleNotFoundError: fastapi; local environment missing dependency)*.

## gc.15 Trigger Word Dashboard - 2025-09-29T19:53:16Z
- Updated `app/ui/dashboard.py` to include trigger word alert data in dashboard metrics payloads.
- Refreshed `templates/dashboard.html` with a safety alerts panel showing summary stats, configured keywords, and the five most recent matches with links to the statement browser.
- Added auto-refresh logic (60s) so Cloud Run deployments keep the panel up to date post-release.
- Tests: `pytest tests/test_ui_deployment.py` *(fails: ModuleNotFoundError: fastapi; local environment missing dependency)*.

## Build Redis-to-Pub/Sub Bridge for xAPI Pipeline
- [ ] Document the desired message flow from Redis stream to Pub/Sub/BigQuery, including retry and idempotency expectations.
- [ ] Implement a background worker that reads `xapi_statements`, publishes to the configured Pub/Sub topic, and records delivery metadata.
- [ ] Add integration tests (or a stub harness) proving statements posted to `/api/xapi/ingest` propagate to the Pub/Sub bridge.

## Restore `/api/xapi/statements` Ingestion Endpoint
- [ ] Create a FastAPI route that accepts single and batch payloads at `/api/xapi/statements`, reusing existing validation/queue helpers.
- [ ] Update CSV and other internal clients to target the restored endpoint and align responses with existing ingestion models.
- [ ] Cover the new route with end-to-end tests that exercise CSV uploads and direct POSTs for regression safety.

## Fix Statement Status Visibility for Redis Queue
- [ ] Update the status lookup to handle decoded Redis responses and support targeted searches without scanning the entire stream.
- [ ] Emit useful telemetry (found/missed counts, last message IDs) so the UI can surface real queue state.
- [ ] Add tests that queue sample statements then confirm `/api/xapi/statements/{id}` returns the expected payload.

## 2025-09-18 Tail xAPI Pipeline
- [x] Added `scripts/xapi_pipeline_tail.py` to stream ingress (`/api/xapi/recent`), Pub/Sub topic traffic, and BigQuery materialization events.
- [ ] Run end-to-end validation with live credentials and capture sample output for `/project_logs` once available.
