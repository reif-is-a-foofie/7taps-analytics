August Rinehart,"Card 13 (Submit media) Take a minute and sharean audio with us—somethings you learned or that stood out from the pre-course assessment, or just how you're feeling right now.",Submit media,1,3,13,"Okay, there we go. Okay, aside from the basic statistics that were in the course earlier, such as like, two hours is the average screen time, 90% of people feel like they're on their phones too much. Aside from those statistics, I think there was also some prioritizing questions. And so I learned that I prioritize having a real-life connection more than anything else. I think that that's the root of why I want to get off my phone more. It's not just because of screen time. It's because I want to get a stronger connection with real life activities. And then, aside from that, there was a question asking about energy. And I selected the one that said I wanted more energy. And I think that rings true, that I want to get off my phone so I'll have more energy and so that I'm less distracted by, or less drained from just time on my phone. Yeah."
Devin Mulac,"Card 13 (Submit media) Take a minute and sharean audio with us—somethings you learned or that stood out from the pre-course assessment, or just how you're feeling right now.",Submit media,1,3,13,"I didn't do the pre-course assessment, so I'm sharing how I'm feeling these days. I just moved a couple weeks ago and I'm starting a new job. So currently feeling pretty anxious and stressed about whether that's going to be financially viable for me right now. But I'm really enjoying living with my girlfriend and getting to see her every day. So that's kind of the trade-off I'm working with right now."

The lunchtime one kind of surprises me, but the evening slash nighttime one like that makes sense. I feel like."
August Rinehart,Card 29 (Submit media): What time of day is your heaviest usage?,Submit media,2,12,72,"The time of day that I use my phone the most is right after work. It's typically because I had a long work day, which is usually like 10 hours of just looking at Excel sheets and it's pretty boring. So then I spend, I come home and to relax, I should be doing something else, but to relax I usually just start watching videos and it takes. It leads into like a two hour time. That's pretty much where I spend the most amount of time. Or right before bed. I don't spend any time in the mornings and I don't spend any time at work. So the only times it can really be is in the afternoon and right before I go to bed."
Devin Mulac,Card 29 (Submit media): What time of day is your heaviest usage?,Submit media,2,12,72,"I don't know anything about working my phone settings, so I couldn't actually figure out the answer to this question. So that might be a good thing to put in is how to find this because I'm very bad at using phones. If I had to guess though, I would say it's probably evening time because I'm usually kinda either making food, using my phone to look at a recipe, or like trying to watch something or a sports game and streaming it from my phone to the tv or watching not my phone, but just in general. Heaviest users definitely be aiming just watching sports."

Hugo Crainich,Card 29 (Submit media): What time of day is your heaviest usage?,Submit media,2,12,72,"The time of day where I would use my phone the most would definitely be at night, probably anywhere after 10pm because it's dark, people are in bed and there's not much to do. It's not that surprising. And I forget the second question that was asked. But yeah, it's not surprising. It makes sense because there's less activity going on. But yeah, it's probably not good for me."

It's a lot to do with climate tech, energy, like renewable energy, climate bonds, etc. That's stuff that interests me, so I hope that I'm following my passion on that via either working at a company. Or starting my own company. I hope, whatever it is, that I'm actually growing a lot in the next five years. I still have a sponge mindset. I'm curious and trying to learn a lot. I also hope that I have friends in every single location that I want to travel to. That's pretty vague. I just want friends all over the country and all over the world that I can go visit and travel to. Experience their cultures with them. Um, I love hanging with people in different locations, um, and yeah, um. And also I hope that I have this is a little bit of a more niche one, but I hope that I have a skill. I was thinking about this the other day, my mom and I were talking about this like I. We don't think that we have like a skill that if we were like, completely resetting life, we could just like, sit down on the street and like, perform, like a dance, or like piano, or like singing or comedy. It's just like a core trait that you have that people enjoy. It's not from just like being social or smart. You know, it's like a tangible trait. So I hope that I can develop something like that. That's not more of a life goal. That's just something like cool, that I wish I could do. Yeah."

Like, I want to go to the gym more, but I'm at work and then I don't know. I have a lot of like for job prospect goals and for hanging out with friend goals and all that kind of stuff. It's very hard to balance that all in life. Just because, like, I don't know, I'll wake up at 7 in the morning, get ready for my job at 9, leave at 5.30, 6. Go to the gym, cook a meal, and then it's already 9 o'clock. And I don't like getting less than eight hours of sleep because I get a little grouchy. So just finding time is difficult. And then on the weekends, balancing that time between. Should I be hanging out with friends or should I be preparing myself for something in the future? It's a lot of contradicting goals.
