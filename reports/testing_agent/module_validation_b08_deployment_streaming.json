All 24 independent tests passed, validating production-ready deployment with security, monitoring, health checks, and resource management. Implementation includes enhanced Docker Compose configuration with all required services (postgres, redis, learninglocker, sqlpad, app), production-optimized Dockerfile with security features, comprehensive deployment status monitoring endpoint, and all required health endpoints. Real-world testing confirms Docker and Docker Compose are available and configuration validates successfully. All production dependencies are included in requirements.txt. The module is ready for production deployment."
