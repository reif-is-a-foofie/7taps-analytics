# AI Content Analysis Improvement Options

## 1. üîß Prompt Engineering & Model Tuning

### Current Issues:
- Missed nuanced depression: "I feel so empty inside, like nothing matters anymore"
- Over-flagged metaphors: "This assignment is killing me with all the work"
- Severity calibration: Trauma rated HIGH instead of CRITICAL

### Solutions:

#### A. Enhanced Prompt with Context Awareness
```python
# Current prompt is too generic
# New prompt should include:
- Learning context awareness (this is a wellness course)
- Distinguish between metaphorical vs literal language
- Better severity calibration guidelines
- Examples of what NOT to flag (common expressions)
```

#### B. Multi-Step Analysis
```python
# Step 1: Context detection
"Is this in a learning/educational context?"
"Is this metaphorical or literal language?"

# Step 2: Risk assessment  
"What is the actual risk level?"
"Are there specific threats or just general distress?"

# Step 3: Severity calibration
"Rate severity based on immediacy and specificity"
```

## 2. üìä Data-Driven Improvements

### A. Custom Training Data
```python
# Create domain-specific training examples:
- Wellness course context examples
- Common metaphorical expressions in learning
- Nuanced mental health indicators
- Severity calibration examples
```

### B. Feedback Loop System
```python
# Implement user feedback:
- "Was this correctly flagged?" buttons
- "Severity too high/low?" adjustments  
- "False positive" reporting
- Learn from corrections over time
```

## 3. üéõÔ∏è Multi-Model Approach

### A. Specialized Models
```python
# Different models for different concerns:
- Self-harm detection model (high precision)
- Mental health distress model (nuanced detection)
- Context understanding model (metaphor vs literal)
- Severity calibration model
```

### B. Ensemble Scoring
```python
# Combine multiple models:
final_score = (
    self_harm_model * 0.4 +
    mental_health_model * 0.3 + 
    context_model * 0.2 +
    severity_model * 0.1
)
```

## 4. üîç Advanced Detection Features

### A. Contextual Awareness
```python
# Add learning context:
- Course progress tracking
- Previous statement history
- User engagement patterns
- Time-based context (midnight vs daytime)
```

### B. Behavioral Patterns
```python
# Track user patterns:
- Escalating distress over time
- Sudden changes in tone
- Repeated concerning statements
- Contextual triggers (specific lessons)
```

## 5. ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Tuning

### A. Adjustable Sensitivity
```python
# Runtime configuration:
SAFETY_CONFIG = {
    "sensitivity_level": "medium",  # low, medium, high, critical
    "metaphor_tolerance": 0.8,      # 0.0-1.0
    "context_awareness": True,
    "severity_threshold": {
        "critical": 0.95,
        "high": 0.85,
        "medium": 0.70
    }
}
```

### B. Domain-Specific Rules
```python
# Wellness course specific:
WELLNESS_RULES = {
    "common_metaphors": [
        "killing me with work",
        "driving me crazy", 
        "stressed to death"
    ],
    "learning_expressions": [
        "struggling with",
        "challenging but",
        "need to work on"
    ],
    "concerning_patterns": [
        "want to die",
        "end it all",
        "hurt myself"
    ]
}
```
